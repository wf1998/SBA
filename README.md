## Statement

All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU.

Due to the sensitive or proprietary nature of our full training dataset (e.g., high-cost annotated data, synthetic data with privacy considerations, and data subject to third-party usage agreements), we are unable to publicly release the complete dataset for now. To ensure transparency and reproducibility of our research, we have provided the following:

1. **Models and Dataset**: Due to the limited storage capacity of the anonymous repository, we are unable to upload the full dataset and models. Additionally, uploading the full dataset to a public platform like Hugging Face at this stage would violate the conferenceâ€™s double-blind review rules. Therefore, we have randomly selected and uploaded a representative subset of the datasets. These subsets can help readers run our code normally. 
5. **Data Generation/Preprocessing Code**: We have included complete code for generating synthetic data and preprocessing the raw data, enabling researchers to replicate our experimental pipeline with similar data.
6. **Core Code Release**: We have publicly released the core code for training, evaluation, and preprocessing, enabling researchers to fully replicate our experimental pipeline and verify the reported results.
7. **Post-Acceptance Commitment**: Upon formal acceptance of this paper by any conference or journal, we will publicly release the complete model and dataset on Hugging Face to further support open research and reproducibility.
