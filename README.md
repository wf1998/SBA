## Statement

Due to the sensitive or proprietary nature of our full training dataset (e.g., high-cost annotated data, synthetic data with privacy considerations, and data subject to third-party usage agreements), we are unable to publicly release the complete dataset for now. To ensure transparency and reproducibility of our research, we have provided the following:

1. **Representative Subset**: We have released a representative subset of the training data. These data can help readers run our code normally. 
2. **Data Generation/Preprocessing Code**: We have included complete code for generating synthetic data and preprocessing the raw data, enabling researchers to replicate our experimental pipeline with similar data.
3. **Core Code Release**: We have publicly released the core code for training, evaluation, and preprocessing, enabling researchers to fully replicate our experimental pipeline and verify the reported results.
4. **Post-Acceptance Commitment**: Upon formal acceptance of this paper by any conference or journal, we will publicly release the complete model and dataset on Hugging Face to further support open research and reproducibility.
